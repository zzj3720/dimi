# Contributing to k-3720

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This project moves quickly, and thoughtful contributions from the community are what keep it sharp. The guide below walks you through how we work so your PR has the best chance of landing smoothly.

## Before You Start

k-3720 already has opinions on CLI/TUI behavior, agent workflows, and public APIs. If your change shifts that direction, open an issue first so we can align before you invest time in a PR.

We hold AI-assisted contributions to the same standard as hand-written ones. **You should understand what you submit** — what changed, how it behaves at the edges, and why it fits this codebase. If you cannot explain that, the PR is not ready for review.

We only merge PRs aligned with the roadmap. Drive-by refactors without context are unlikely to land.

**Discuss first** — open an issue before coding. PRs without prior discussion may be closed without review:

- New features or user-visible behavior changes (regardless of size)
- Refactors or other changes larger than ~100 lines
- Public API or compatibility changes
- Bug fixes where the cause or fix approach is still unclear

**Can open a PR directly** — link an existing issue when there is one:

- Clear, reproducible bug fixes with a focused diff
- Typos, documentation-only changes, and small CI/build fixes
- Small changes that clearly match an existing issue or maintainer request

## Project Layout

This is a pnpm monorepo. The most relevant entry points are:

- `apps/kimi-code` — CLI / TUI; the path is retained from the upstream Kimi Code codebase
- `apps/mobile` — native Android client
- `apps/relay` and `packages/remote` — encrypted remote transport
- `apps/vis` — session replay & debugging visualizer
- `packages/node-sdk` — public TypeScript SDK (`@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk`)
- `packages/agent-core-v2`, `kaos`, `oauth`, `telemetry` — internal runtime packages
- `docs/` — VitePress bilingual docs site

For the full project map, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Development Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js >= 24.15.0, pnpm 10.33.0, Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zzj3720/k-3720.git
cd k-3720
pnpm install
```

Useful scripts:

- `pnpm dev:cli` — run the CLI in dev mode
- `pnpm test` — run tests (vitest)
- `pnpm typecheck` — TypeScript check (note: builds packages first)
- `pnpm lint` — oxlint
- `pnpm lint:fix` — oxlint with auto-fix
- `pnpm build` — build all packages

## Commit Convention

All commits and PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

| Type     | Use for                                   | Example                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| feat     | A new feature                             | feat(agent-core): add tool dedup        |
| fix      | A bug fix                                 | fix(tui): correct status bar alignment  |
| docs     | Documentation only                        | docs: clarify install instructions      |
| chore    | Tooling / housekeeping                    | chore: bump dependencies                |
| refactor | Internal refactor without behavior change | refactor(runtime): extract retry helper |
| test     | Adding or improving tests                 | test(agent-core): cover skill resolver  |
| ci       | CI / build pipeline changes               | ci: cache pnpm store                    |
| build    | Build system / artifact changes           | build(native): add win32-arm64 target   |
| perf     | Performance improvement                   | perf(session): batch event flushes      |
| style    | Formatting only (no logic)                | style: apply oxlint --fix               |

PR titles are enforced by the `pr-title-checker` workflow — a non-conforming title will block merge.

## Changesets

This repo uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and releases.

- Every PR that affects release artifacts (code, behavior, public API) **must** include a changeset.
- Docs-only, test-only, or CI-only PRs may skip changesets.
- Generate one with `pnpm changeset` and follow the prompts (which packages are touched, which bump level).
- For repo-specific conventions on package selection and bump levels, see `.changeset/README.md`. When working in this repo with coding agents, use the `gen-changesets` skill.

## Pull Requests

Use the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) when opening a feature pull request.

PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](#commit-convention); CI runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` on every PR. Update user-facing docs in `docs/` when behavior changes — use the `gen-docs` skill when working with coding agents.

## Code Style

- TypeScript across the codebase.
- Linting via `oxlint` (config in `.oxlintrc.json`).
- Auto-formatting via `pnpm lint:fix`.
- Follow existing local patterns when the lint rules do not cover a style choice.
