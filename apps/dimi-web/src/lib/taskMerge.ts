/**
 * Append the live-only swarm subagents that a fresh REST `/tasks` list does not
 * contain.
 *
 * REST `/tasks` lists only the main agent's background-task store — it never
 * returns foreground swarm subagents (kind `'subagent'`), which arrive purely
 * through the WS event stream. Both the session-load task fetch and the 1s
 * output poll rebuild `tasksBySession` from that REST list, so a plain replace
 * would drop the subagents on every refresh and the next event would re-add
 * them, flickering the swarm/subagent cards (and their live "currently doing"
 * line) about once per second.
 *
 * Keep WS-owned subagent tasks that REST omits, so the REST refresh only governs
 * background tasks. REST stays authoritative for anything it does return.
 *
 * One exception: REST DOES return background subagents — keyed by their
 * background-task id, while the WS stream keys the same agent by agent id
 * (`backgroundTaskId` links the two, set from the `task.started`
 * registration). Fold the REST copy into the WS-owned row so one agent does
 * not surface as two rows; REST still corrects a terminal status the WS row
 * may have missed while disconnected.
