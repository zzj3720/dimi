/**
 * Decode raw stdin bytes into a comparable printable character.
 *
 * When a terminal (e.g. the VSCode integrated terminal) enables the Kitty
 * keyboard protocol disambiguate flag, ordinary printable keys are sent as
 * CSI-u sequences: pressing `r` arrives as "\x1b[114u", pressing `q` as
 * "\x1b[113u". A bare `data === 'q'` comparison inside a Container's
 * `handleInput` therefore never matches under Kitty-mode terminals.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Every bare-literal printable-character comparison (letters, digits,
 *   space, punctuation) must go through this function first.
 * - Functional keys (arrows, Enter, Tab, Esc, ...) continue to use
 *   `matchesKey(data, Key.*)`; pi-tui's `matchesKey` already handles Kitty.
 * - Control characters (codepoint < 32, e.g. ctrl-b, ctrl-f) may still
 *   compare against the raw `data` — `decodeKittyPrintable` rejects them.
 *
 * The module's existence is itself the "don't forget to decode" constraint:
 * `test/tui/printable-key-guard.test.ts` scans every `handleInput` under
 * `tui/components/**` and rejects bare-literal comparisons.
