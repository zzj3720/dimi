/**
 * Transport-agnostic channel contract for the debug-RPC client — the
 * old-klient / VS Code `ProxyChannel` model: the channel is bound to one
 * Service (the URL carries the scope + the Service's decorator id) and
 * `command` is the method name, invoked by reflection on the server.
 *
 * `listen` is kept for contract completeness (Service `onXxx` emitters map to
 * it), but the `/api/v1/debug` surface is HTTP-only — the v2 event socket
 * (`/api/v2/ws`) that used to serve it was removed — so the HTTP channel's
 * `listen` throws and panels fetch on demand instead.
