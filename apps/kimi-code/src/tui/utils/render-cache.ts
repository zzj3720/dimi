 * Render-cache toggle for TUI message components.
 *
 * The transcript re-renders the entire component tree on every frame, and
 * most message components rebuild their `render(width)` output from scratch
 * even when their content has not changed. Caching the rendered lines (keyed
 * on width + a dirty flag) turns an unchanged message's render into an O(1)
 * array reference return, which is the dominant per-frame cost once the
 * transcript grows long.
 *
 * The cache is on by default and can be disabled with
 * `DIMI_TUI_NO_RENDER_CACHE=1` as an escape hatch (and to let benchmarks
 * compare cached vs. uncached runs in the same process).
