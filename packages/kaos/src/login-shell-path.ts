/**
 * Login-shell PATH probe — enrich `process.env.PATH` with entries from the
 * user's login shell.
 *
 * When dimi is launched from a context that skipped the user's shell
 * profile (GUI launchers, non-login parent shells), `process.env.PATH`
 * misses entries like `/opt/homebrew/bin`, so commands spawned by the Bash
 * tool can't find tools the user has in their interactive shell (e.g.
 * `gh`). We run the user's login shell once (`$SHELL -l -c /usr/bin/env`),
 * extract its PATH, and append the entries the current PATH lacks. Existing
 * entries keep their order and priority; failures (no resolvable shell,
 * hung or broken profile) silently leave PATH untouched.
 *
 * launchd/daemon launches can leave `$SHELL` unset or blank (see
 * `defaultShell()` in agent-core's terminalService for the same case), so
 * the probe falls back to the OS account's login shell from the user
 * database before giving up.
 *
 * Like `detectEnvironment`, the probe is a pure function of injected deps
 * so the suite runs identically on any host. Windows is skipped: the
 * problem is specific to POSIX login-shell profiles.
