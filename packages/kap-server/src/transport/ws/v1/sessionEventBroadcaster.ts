/**
 * `SessionEventBroadcaster` — per-session single fan-out point that turns agent
 * events (via the per-agent `IEventBus`) into a sequenced,
 * journaled, replayable `/api/v1/ws` event stream (the `{seq, epoch}` watermark).
 *
 * Port of v1's `WSBroadcastService` (`packages/server/.../wsBroadcastService.ts`),
 * adapted to v2 where agent events live on the per-agent `IEventBus`
 * (not a Core firehose). For each session it:
 *
 *   1. Subscribes to every agent's `IEventBus` via
 *      `IAgentLifecycleService` reach-down-via-handle (and `onDidCreate` /
 *      `onDidDispose` for late agents); `record` emissions are persisted and not
 *      broadcast (see step 3). The same lifecycle callbacks fan durable
 *      `agent.created` / `agent.disposed` facts out at session granularity
 *      (they bypass per-subscription agent allowlists but never leave the
 *      session). Also subscribes to the session's
 *      `ISessionInteractionService` and synthesizes the v1 approval/question
 *      protocol events from pending-set changes and resolutions.
 *   2. Attaches `agentId`/`sessionId` to build the wire `Event`.
 *   3. Classifies durable vs volatile — `isVolatileSignal` for the agent
 *      wire-emission path (`isVolatileEventType` remains for the global/model path).
 *   4. Durable events: assign the next per-session `seq` (monotonic across
 *      restarts), persist to the `SessionEventJournal`, cache in an in-memory
 *      tail, fan out.
 *   5. Volatile events: fan out live with the current durable watermark as
 *      `seq` and `volatile: true`. Never journaled, never replayed.
 *   6. Exposes replay (`getBufferedSince`) keyed by `{seq, epoch}` cursors and
 *      an atomic `getSnapshotState` for the snapshot route.
 *
 * A session is activated (journaling starts) on first `subscribe` /
 * `getSnapshotState` / `getCursor` and stays active for the process lifetime so
 * the journal is continuous from first activation onward.
 *
 * Fan-out split: global events ({@link isGlobalEvent} — `session.meta.updated`
 * plus the `event.session.*` / `event.workspace.*` / `event.config.*`
 * families, including every session's `event.session.work_changed`) are pushed
 * to EVERY established connection (registered via
 * {@link SessionEventBroadcaster.addGlobalTarget}, no subscription needed)
 * union every subscribed target. Session/agent events only reach connections
 * subscribed to that session, subject to the per-subscription agent allowlist
 * and the transcript suppression below. Transcript frames (`transcript.reset`
 * / `transcript.ops`) are a separate channel: they are governed by the
 * per-agent transcript grades alone and bypass the agent allowlist entirely.
 *
 * Transcript dedup: a connection subscribed to the transcript protocol
 * (grade ≠ 'off' for the emitting agent) no longer receives the
 * `session_event`s the transcript already projects — see
 * {@link TRANSCRIPT_PROJECTED_EVENT_TYPES}. Suppression is a per-connection
 * send-view crop only: the journal and tail keep recording every event, and
 * connections without a transcript spec are unaffected.
