/**
 * `modelCatalog` domain (L2) — the `ModelRequester` contract: per-turn input,
 * streamed events, and the per-turn intent carrier `ModelRequestParams`.
 *
 * `ModelRequestParams` is how every per-turn intent reaches the wire: prompt-cache
 * key, sampling overrides, thinking effort/keep, and the completion-token
 * budget (with its window-clamp companions). It is deliberately dialect-free —
 * each wire dialect encodes (or silently drops) an intent in its own hooks.
 * The requester maps the params onto `GenerateOptions` 1:1; the fixed overlay
 * order inside the bases is `cacheKey → sampling → thinking →
 * maxCompletionTokens`.
