# Check Kimi Code docs (check-kimi-code-docs)

Answer Kimi Code **product** questions from the official documentation site, not from memory. This skill covers product usage ("how do I configure a provider", "what does this error mean", "how does membership quota work"); it is not for developing the Kimi Code repository itself.

## The single source of truth

Official documentation (English):

```
https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/
```

## How to answer

1. Pick the page from the table above.
2. **FetchURL the page before answering** — answer strictly from the fetched content, never from memory.
3. Cite the page link(s) you used at the end of the answer.
4. If the fetch fails or the docs do not cover the question, say so plainly: answer from what you already know, attach the docs entry link (`https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/`), and mark which parts you could not verify. **Never invent config keys, command names, model IDs, or product behaviors.**
