/**
 * `wire` domain (L2) — Model definition primitive (`ModelDef` / `defineModel`),
 * `DeepReadonly<T>` (the compile-time half of immutability), and the
 * `ModelBlobCodec` / `PartsTransformer` types that let a model declare how to
 * dehydrate large inline media before persistence and rehydrate blob references
 * in its state after replay.
 *
 * A `ModelDef` is a stateless descriptor: it names a model, manufactures its
 * initial state via `initial`, and declares the model's Ops through
 * `defineOp` (the model-bound form of the primitive in `op.ts`). It never
 * holds state itself — per-scope state
 * instances are owned by `IWireService`, and domain services read them through
 * `wire.getModel(model)`. The optional `blobs` codec declares both directions
 * of the blob offload pipeline:
 * - `dehydrate(record, transform)`: called per-record at dispatch time; the
 *   model traverses its record structure, passes each `ContentPart[]` through
 *   `transform` (which offloads oversized data URIs to blob storage and returns
 *   parts with `blobref:` URLs), and returns the transformed record.
 * - `rehydrate(state, transform)`: called once after replay; the model
 *   traverses the surviving final state, passes each `ContentPart[]` through
 *   `transform` (which loads blob references back to inline data URIs), and
 *   returns the transformed state. Only the *surviving* state is rehydrated,
 *   skipping data that was later removed by compaction.
 *
 * Both directions receive a `PartsTransformer` — the same function shape — so
 * the model owns the traversal logic and `WireService` owns the storage I/O.
 * `PartsTransformer` uses `readonly unknown[]` rather than `ContentPart[]` so
 * this file stays free of `llmProtocol` imports (L2 → L3 boundary); the
 * cast happens once inside `WireService`.
 *
 * A primary Model may register cross-model reducers keyed by foreign op types:
 * `WireService` runs them on both dispatch and restore, so v1-derived
 * restore effects can stay replayable without persisting extra records.
 * `DeepReadonly<T>` recursively maps a state type to its deeply-readonly view
 * for the references returned by `getModel`: functions pass
 * through, `Map` / `Set` widen to `ReadonlyMap` / `ReadonlySet`, arrays and
 * tuples widen to `ReadonlyArray`, plain objects become a readonly mapped type,
 * and primitives are unchanged. It pairs with the runtime `Object.freeze`
 * applied by `WireService` after every `apply`. Scope-agnostic.
