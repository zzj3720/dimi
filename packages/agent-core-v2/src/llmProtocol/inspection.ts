 * Anthropic profile table, protocol base catalog), an env-bag fallback, a
 * synthesized computation, or no source at all. `InspectionSource` is the
 * L0 vocabulary for naming that origin; `ResolutionTrace` is the collector
 * the resolver (`modelCatalog`) records into while assembling a Model, so the
 * on-demand `IModelCatalog.inspect` view can report *why* a value is what it
 * is — never re-resolving, just reading the trace of the same resolution
 * `get` served.
