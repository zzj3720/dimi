/**
 * `toolExecutor` domain (L3) — tool-execution event and hook contexts.
 *
 * Defines the event objects and context records carried by
 * `IAgentToolExecutorService`'s execution-interception surface:
 *
 * - `onBeforeExecuteTool` (veto event, `BeforeToolExecuteEvent`): listeners
 *   answer with `veto(result)` (replace the execution with the given tool
 *   result — an `isError: true` result reads as a denial, anything else as a
 *   short-circuit; first one wins), `allow()` (final pass, ends all
 *   adjudication), `pass(metadata)` (pass with an `executionMetadata` trace,
 *   ends nothing), or `waitUntil(factory)` (defer an adjudication that needs
 *   external input — the fire side invokes the cold factory only when no
 *   listener vetoed or allowed outright, so an ask round-trip can never start
 *   while another listener would have denied). No ids, no ordering contract.
 * - `onWillExecuteTool` (waitUntil participation event,
 *   `WillExecuteToolEvent`): listeners attach hot promises via
 *   `waitUntil(promise)`; the executor awaits all of them before dispatching
 *   an allowed call (e.g. MCP initial load).
 * - `hooks.onDidExecuteTool` (ordered hook slot, `ToolDidExecuteContext`):
 *   post-execution result finalization, kept as an `OrderedHookSlot`. Every
 *   call reaches it — including preflight-rejected ones (missing/unavailable
 *   tool, guard denial, invalid args), which arrive without `tool` set.
 *
 * Participants such as `permissionGate`, `toolDedupe`, `externalHooks`,
 * `goal`, `plan`, `swarm`, `btw`, and `mcp` register through these surfaces.
 * Pure contract (types only); no scoped service.
