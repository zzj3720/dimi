/**
 * MCP tool adapter — wraps a remote MCP tool as an `ExecutableTool`.
 *
 * Each tool exposed by a connected MCP server is adapted into an
 * `ExecutableTool` whose `resolveExecution` forwards the call to the client
 * and normalizes the result. When a call fails, the adapter picks one of
 * three recoveries based on why it failed:
 *
 * - The server answered (a JSON-RPC error, or a response that failed
 *   client-side schema validation) → the error is rethrown; reconnecting
 *   would not change the answer.
 * - The failure is ambiguous (a raw fetch/socket error) → the client is
 *   probed with a ping: alive means a transient blip and the call is
 *   retried once in place; dead means the transport is gone.
 * - The transport is provably dead (the SDK fired `onclose`, or the probe
 *   failed) → the server is reconnected once through `options.reconnect`
 *   and the call retried on the fresh client, so a dropped connection
 *   surfaces as a slow call instead of a failed turn.
 *
 * Retries are at-least-once: if the transport died after the server
 * processed the call but before the response arrived, the retry may
 * duplicate side effects. There is no protocol-level dedup across
 * reconnects, so this trade-off is accepted deliberately.
