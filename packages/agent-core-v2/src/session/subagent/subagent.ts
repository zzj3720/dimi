/**
 * `subagent` domain (L6) — `ISessionSubagentService` contract: driving turns
 * on other agents, plus the hook / event surface those runs announce.
 *
 * Split out of `agentLifecycle`: the lifecycle registry owns *existence*
 * (create / fork / lookup / removal); this domain owns *runs* — one agent
 * driving a turn on another and the requester-side announcements that come
 * with it. The `onWillStartAgentTask` hook slot and the `onDidStopAgentTask`
 * event are run by `mirrorAgentRun` when one agent drives another, so
 * observers such as the Session-scope `externalHooks` adapter can translate
 * them into the `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` external hook commands.
 * Session-scoped — one instance per session.
