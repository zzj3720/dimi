 * `btw` domain — side-question ("by the way") child agent contract.

 * A `btw` agent is a lightweight fork of the main agent used for a side-channel
 * conversation: it inherits the parent's profile and context, but all tool calls
 * are disabled and a side-channel system reminder is appended so it answers with
 * text only. Follow-up turns reuse the same child agent.

This is a side-channel conversation with the user. You should answer user questions directly based on what you already know.

IMPORTANT:
- The main agent continues independently; do not reference this side channel.
- Do not call any tools. All tool calls are disabled and will be rejected.
  Even though tool definitions are visible in this request, they exist only
  for technical reasons (prompt cache). You must not use them.
- Respond only with text based on what you already know from the conversation
  and this side-channel conversation.
- Follow-up turns may happen in this side-channel conversation.
- If you do not know the answer, say so directly.
