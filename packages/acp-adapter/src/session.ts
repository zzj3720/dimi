   *    surface as `RequestError.authRequired()` so the ACP client can
   *    drive its own re-auth UX rather than a generic internal error.
   *  - Everything else becomes `RequestError.internalError(...)` with
   *    the stack/message logged to the agent log file but NOT exposed
   *    to the client (the JSON-RPC layer would otherwise leak details).
   *  - Auth-coded failures may arrive on TWO paths: a `turn.ended`
   *    event with `reason: 'failed'` and an `event.error` payload, OR
   *    a synchronous `session.prompt(...)` rejection. Both are
   *    routed through {@link mapPromptError} for parity.
   *
   * Subscribes to the session event stream; for every `assistant.delta`,
   * pushes an `agent_message_chunk` `session/update` notification to the
   * client. Resolves with the ACP `PromptResponse` (containing
   * `stopReason`) when a `turn.ended` event arrives.
   *
   * Cleanup invariants:
   *  - The event subscription is unsubscribed on EVERY exit path
   *    (success, cancel, failed turn, and `session.prompt()` rejection).
   *  - If `session.prompt()` rejects synchronously or asynchronously, the
   *    rejection is propagated as a `prompt` request error so the client
   *    sees a JSON-RPC error rather than a hung request.
