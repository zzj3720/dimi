# Slash Commands

Slash commands are built-in control commands provided by Kimi Code CLI in the interactive TUI, covering account configuration, session management, mode switching, information queries, and more. Type `/` in the input box to trigger command completion — the candidate list filters in real time as you continue typing; command aliases are also matched.

After typing the full command name, press `Enter` to execute. If the `/`-prefixed input does not match any built-in or Skill command, it is sent to the Agent as a regular message.

::: tip
Some commands are only available in the idle state. Executing these commands while a session is streaming output or compacting context will be blocked — press `Esc` or `Ctrl-C` to interrupt first. The "Always available" column in the tables below indicates commands that are also available during streaming.

| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `/yolo [on\|off]` | `/yes` | Toggle YOLO mode. Without arguments, flips the current state; explicitly passing `on`/`off` forces the setting. When enabled, skips approval for regular tool calls; Plan mode exit approval is not affected                      | Yes              |
| `/auto [on\|off]` | —      | Toggle auto permission mode. When enabled, tool approvals are handled automatically and the Agent will not ask the user questions                                                                                                 | Yes              |
| `/plan [on\|off]` | —      | Toggle Plan mode. Without arguments, flips the current state; explicitly passing `on`/`off` forces the setting. Simply toggling does not create an empty plan file                                                                | Yes              |

| `/swarm on\|off`  | —      | Turn swarm mode on or off without sending a prompt.                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes              |
| `/swarm <task>`   | —      | Turn swarm mode on, then send `<task>` as a normal prompt. If the turn completes normally, swarm mode turns off automatically. In `manual` permission mode, Kimi Code asks whether to switch to `auto` or `yolo` before starting. | No               |
| `/goal [...]`     | —      | Start or manage an autonomous goal                                                                                                                                                                                                | See below        |

::: warning
`/yolo` skips approval for regular tool calls. Please make sure you understand the potential risks before enabling it. Plan mode exit approval is not bypassed by `/yolo`; `Bash` inside Plan mode is still subject to the regular `/yolo` allow rules.

## Autonomous Goal

`/goal` starts or manages goal mode: a persistent objective that Kimi Code works toward across automatically continuing turns. For usage guidance and examples, see [Goals](../guides/goals.md).

```sh
/goal Update the checkout docs, run docs build, and stop if still blocked after 20 turns
```

In the edit field, use <kbd>Shift-Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-J</kbd> for a new line and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save | Always available |

The words `status`, `pause`, `resume`, `cancel`, `replace`, and `next` act as subcommands only when they are the first word after `/goal`. If your objective needs to start with one of those words, put `--` before it:

```sh
/goal -- cancel the old rollout note after the new docs are published
```

If an upcoming goal needs to start with `manage`, put `--` after `next`:

```sh
/goal next -- manage the release checklist
```

In non-interactive prompt mode, only the create forms start goal mode:

```sh
kimi -p "/goal Fix the failing checkout test"
```

Prompt mode exits with code `0` when the goal completes, `3` when it blocks, and `6` when it pauses. Other `/goal` subcommands, including `next`, are TUI controls and are not handled by `kimi -p`.

## Built-in skill commands

Kimi Code CLI ships with a set of built-in Skills that appear directly as `/<name>` slash commands. Unlike external Skills, they do not require the `skill:` prefix and are available out of the box.

| Command                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/mcp-config`            | Configure MCP servers and handle MCP OAuth login. See [MCP](../customization/mcp.md)                                                                                                             |
| `/custom-theme [<text>]` | Create or edit a custom TUI color theme. See [Themes](../customization/themes.md)                                                                                                                |
| `/update-config`         | Inspect or edit `config.toml` (model, provider, permission, hooks) and `tui.toml` (theme, editor, notifications, auto-update)                                                                    |
| `/check-kimi-code-docs`  | Answer Kimi Code product questions (CLI usage, configuration, membership, error codes) against the official docs                                                                                 |
| `/import-from-cc-codex`  | Import Claude Code and Codex instructions, skills, and MCP settings into Kimi Code                                                                                                               |
| `/sub-skill`             | Discover and reorganize the local skill inventory into hierarchical sub-skill bundles. Includes `/sub-skill.review` (read-only proposal) and `/sub-skill.consolidate` (apply the reorganization) |

All built-in Skill commands are only available in the idle state.

## Skill Dynamic Commands

Activated external Skills are automatically registered as slash commands. Ordinary external Skills use the `skill:` namespace prefix:

```
/skill:<name> [extra text]
```

For example, `/skill:code-style` loads the Skill named `code-style` and sends it to the Agent; any text appended after the command is concatenated to the Skill prompt.

External sub-skills appear directly in the slash command panel with dotted names:

```
/<parent-skill>.<sub-skill> [extra text]
```

For example, a child Skill named `review` inside a parent Skill named `code-style` is shown as `/code-style.review`. The dotted command name is derived from the hierarchy; the child `SKILL.md` can keep its local `name`.

For convenience, external Skill commands also support a shorthand form that omits the `skill:` prefix — `/<name>` — as long as the name is not taken by a system slash command. That is, `/code-style` falls back to matching `/skill:code-style`.

Built-in Skills shipped with Kimi Code CLI appear directly as `/<name>` in the slash command panel. For example, `/mcp-config` helps configure MCP servers and handle MCP OAuth login, and `/custom-theme [extra text]` invokes the custom-theme workflow to create or edit a TUI theme.

::: info
All Skill commands are only available in the idle state. `flow`-type Skills are also exposed via `/skill:<name>` — there is no separate `/flow:` namespace.
